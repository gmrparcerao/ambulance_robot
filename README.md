## Introduction

Ambulance Robot aims to build an autonomous robot in the theme of an ambulance, utilizing the NRF24L01 transceiver to communicate, HC-SR04 ultrasonic and QRE1113 infrared sensor for the positioning of the car, a microcontroller to control them, the Wiring language and the Arduino software were used in programming. The robot should be able to perform the pre-established course, starting whenever receives the wireless signal, stop when it receives another signal from the house that called for the ambulance and finish the course after that. It was characterized by a siren and the ambulance sound.

The project was made as part of the semestral multidisciplinar project in Sao Paulo State Technology College of Itaquera "Professor Miguel Reale" and used in 8th Fatec Itaquera Robot Competition.
